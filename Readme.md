## MTTS(Malayalam Text to Speech system)

With this project we are planning to create Text to Speech system in Malayalam. Text to speech systems convert any written text into spoken speech. Text-to-speech systems is a vital step for accessibility to disabledpeople  like  blind and deaf. It can be  used ineducational  applications as  well.  Most of the  text-to-speech systems are  currently made for English language. The objective of this
project is to create an accurate and steady Text-to Speech system for Malayalam.

A detatiled Literature survey on Text to speech systems which was published in IJRAR journal titled: **A study of Text to Speech system for Non-English Languages** can be found [here](http://www.ijrar.org/papers/IJRAR19K8100.pdf).
